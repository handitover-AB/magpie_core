"""This module offers a modified expect function for use with Magpie.

The main differences are:
* Overload expect for arbirtary expressions that are
  not Playwright data types. Keep the Playwright assertions for
  Playwright data types (e.g. locators etc) and use assert_that
  assertions on other data types.
* Provide a mechanism for overriding the default assertion timeouts
