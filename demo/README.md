# Demo tests

## Internet Search Test

This test will open up DuckDuckGo and search for "Magpie". A very simple test
which can be used for checking that Magpie is runnable and see where the output
files end up and what they look like. Of course, it is also a brief introduction
to Playwright, if you look at the `actions.py` and `states.py` files.

## Multi-actor Test

A more advanced test, that requres a multi-actor ToDo app to test on.

Unfortunately, the test environment for this was discontinued. Best tip is to search for a ToDoMVC application example with persistence and support for simultaneuos users.
